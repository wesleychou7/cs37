Step 5 - Answer the following questions:

1. Does the code work?
The code does not work

2. What data structure is used for a card?  for a deck of cards?
For card, it used a struct. For a deck of cards, it uses vectors

3. Does it simulate a two player game of poker completely?
No, the code does not run.

4. If not, what is missing...ChatGPT might have even told you what is missing.
ChatGPT is missing a definition for its random_shuffle function.


Step 7 - Answer the following questions:

1. Was the code written the second time different from the first?
Yes.

2. What data structure is used for a card?  for a deck of cards?
For a card, it used a struct. For deck of cards, it used vectors.

3. Did the second program accurately simulate a two player game of poker?
No.

4. What, if anything, is missing from this program?
It is missing a lot of definitions for functions. ChatGPT repeatedly calls functions that don't exist.


If you are not able to get a complete, working program, submit the best result and 
explain the data types and functions it uses and what it is missing, as well as the prompt you used.

The code mostly uses vectors that stores elements of type Card. It has functions to create a deck
of cards, shuffle the deck, deal the cards, and evaluate the players' hands. It is missing several
definitions to the functions used in the main function. I tried to make ChatGPT write these missing
definitions by saying "for this line of code: _____, I am getting this error:____". I basically
repeated this line for every line thats giving me errors. However, ChatGPT's answers only created 
more errors.
